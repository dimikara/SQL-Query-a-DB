# Query a Digital Music Store Database (SQLite)

## <b>The Chinook Database - Introduction</b><br>

In this project, I am querying the [Chinook Database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database) which holds information about a music store. The goal is to assist the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information. 

As a reference for the database & queries, the schema for the Chinook Database is provided below. There we can see the columns that link tables together via the arrows. This diagram is known as an <b>entity-relationship diagram (ERD)</b>, shows us how data is structured in the database and helps us visualize the data we are analyzing.

## <b>Used Skills</b><br>

The main goal of this project is to use SQL for querying the Chinook database. For the execution of SQL queries I am using [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/).



## <b>Project</b><br>

The project consists of the following:<br>

* Writing 4 SQL queries in order to reply to 4 business questions

* Extracting the data to Excel and create an appropriate visualization for each of the questions

* Creating a Presentation file to share the findings. This file contains 4 slides, one for each of the business questions I am querying the database about.



## <b>How to run the queries</b><br>


To run the queries yourself, follow the instructions below:

* Set-up the local environment

The environment is pretty quick to set up. All you'll need to do here is...

1. Download the Chinook database from the [GitHub](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database) site<br>

2. Download the appropriate version of [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/) for your computer setup<br>

3. Connect the Browser to the Database, following the below steps:<br>
    - Open up _DB Browser for SQLite_
    - Click on _Open Database_
    - Navigate to the _Chinook.db_ file in the folder where you saved it
    - Click on the _Execute SQL_
    - Start querying your data

_Note_

* Although here I am using the DB Browser for SQLite, there are many different SQL database browsers that can work with different types of databases.
